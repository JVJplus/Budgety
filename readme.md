## General info
This is a budgeting app that calculates a budget based on a list of income and expenses.
App was created as part of [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview).
This section of the course teaches about module pattern and IIFEs.

The HTML and CSS code involved in this project were pre-written by Mr. Schmedtmann.

We had to write the JS code after watching the videos.
